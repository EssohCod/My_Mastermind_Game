# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
The task is to implement a Mastermind game in C programming language. The challenge lies in handling user input, validating guesses, generating a secret code, and providing feedback to the player based on their guesses.

## Description
The program simulates the Mastermind game, where the player attempts to guess a secret code composed of four distinct pieces out of nine possible options. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the code. After each guess, the program provides feedback on the number of well-placed and misplaced pieces.

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Compile the program using the provided Makefile: make

## Usage
./my_mastermind [-c secret_code] [-t attempts]
-c: Specifies the secret code. If not provided, a random code will be generated.
-t: Specifies the number of attempts. If not provided, the default is 10.

Example usage: bash:
./my_mastermind -c "0123" -t 8
